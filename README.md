- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark
- 👀 I’m interested in creating whatever I can, all of this is new and interesting, Im a big fan of maker channels, such as Zack Freedman and Michael Reeves.
      My dad has also always built fairly large scale projects, such as a Catapult meant for throwing Pumkins, and that inspired me
- 🌱 I’m currently getting a computer scinece degree, 
      Im learning Linux, currently use Manjaro, have used POP_OS! and Ubuntu It isn't my daily driver but I have it on my laptop which I use for school work, admitinglty not much         technical stuff on it, I mostly use windows
- 🏳️‍🌈 Im aro-ace, and genderfluid. I only startec questioning stuff a few years ago cause getting diagnosed with ADHD triggered a journey of self discovery
- 📫 How to reach me ideally by discord at Mark.#8823 or by email at markdl2020@gmail.com email me about anything, even if you just want a friend
