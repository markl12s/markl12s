- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark
- 👀 I’m interested in creating whatever I can, all of this is new and interesting, Im a big fan of maker channels, such as Zack Freedman and Michael Reeves.
      My dad has also always built fairly large scale projects, such as a Catapult meant for throwing Pumkins, and that inspired me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning first year of a computer scinece degree, 
      I knew a bit of python before beginning.
      I just installed Linux (PopOS) on a laptop so Im learning a bit of that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [add later]
- 📫 How to reach me ideally by discord at mark(he/him)#8823 or by email at markdl2020@gmail.com email me about anything, even if you just want a friend
