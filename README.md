- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark
- 👀 I’m interested in creating whatever I can, all of this is new and interesting, Im a big fan of maker channels, such as Zack Freedman and Michael Reeves
      My dad has also always built fairly large scale projects, such as a Catapult meant for throwing Pumkins, and that inspired me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning first year of a computer scinece degree, 
      I knew a bit of python before beginning and I just installed Linux (PopOS) on a laptop so Im learning a bit of that. 
      Im an ADHD Nerd so I can quickly drop everything and start working on something new, sadly that makes school significantly harder
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. Im currently working on a self driving RC car so any help would be great
- 📫 How to reach me ideally by discord at mark(he/him)#8823 or by email at markdl2020@gmail.com email me about anything, even if you just want a friend
